        ABOUT GROCERY SHOPPING
      </h1>
      <p className=" bg-slate-300">
        An online grocer is either a brick-and-mortar supermarket or grocery
        store that allows online ordering, or a standalone e-commerce service
        that includes grocery items. There is usually a delivery charge for this
        service. Brick-and-mortar supermarkets that have built internet channels
        to better service their clients are known as online grocers. Online
        grocery delivery services are available throughout Europe, Asia and
        North America, mostly in urban centers. The online ordering is done
        through e-commerce websites or mobile apps. The COVID-19 pandemic
        greatly accelerated the growth of online grocers, and in the first few
        months of the pandemics online grocery shopping increased by 300%. In
        addition, first-time online grocery shoppers accounted for 41% of online
        grocery shoppers. The epidemic of COVID-19 has hastened the uptake of
        online grocery shopping. Pre-COVID-19 food shopping activity accounted
        for 9% of the market, but 63 percent of consumers worldwide purchased
        more groceries online after the outbreak than they did before they were
        socially isolated

        In-store pickup
      </h2>
      <p className=" bg-slate-300">
        For brick-and-mortar stores that have online ordering, customers can
        place orders online and pick up their ready orders in the store on their
        way home. In-store pickup—sometimes termed "click & collect"—is
        typically offered for same-day shopping. It is usually less expensive
        than delivery, and can be done at a time of the customer's choosing.
        This option is popular in rural areas. It is also useful for customers
        living outside of the store's local delivery area.

        Local delivery
      </h2>
      <p className=" bg-slate-300">
        Most local online grocers have their own drivers. The most common type
        of personal delivery involves storing grocery inventory in a warehouse
        to deliver to customers once orders are placed. Another type of personal
        delivery which is less common is based on just-in-time business in which
        there is no warehouse or inventory. In this type of delivery, customers
        place orders for next-day delivery. The online grocer shops for the
        groceries on the morning of the delivery day. Some grocery fulfilment
        centres are set up as dark stores. Online-only grocers typically have
        warehouses or distribution centers nearby, to allow local shipping of
        refrigerated items. Online grocers with a large regional or national
        delivery area may ship groceries using courier services. If the order
        contains cold or frozen items, this involves "flash freezing" the goods
        and pack them into special shipping containers.[citation needed]
        Companies have experimented with automated delivery modes including
        drone delivery and robots. For instance, in Fall 2016 Washington, D.C.
        approved a trial run of rolling delivery drones produced by Starship
        Technologies. The earthbound robots are similar to wheeled coolers and
        carry around 40 pounds of groceries.

        Platforms
      </h2>
      <p className=" bg-slate-300">
        The online grocer technology platform could be developed in-house, or a
        third party's platform could be re-used and customized to reflect the
        company brand and provide unique features. In some cases, all management
        and support tasks are being outsourced to the platform provider.

        Market size and share
      </h2>
      <p className=" bg-slate-300">
        In the United States, as of 2017, Amazon.com sold $2 billion worth of
        groceries online. It had the largest market share, 18%, followed by
        Walmart. Amazon has acquired Whole Foods Market to help accelerate their
        growth efforts in the online grocery sector. Other companies with
        substantial market share in the US are Target and Instacart. The value
        of the US online grocery market has grown from $12 billion in 2016 to
        $26 billion in 2018 and it has plenty of room to grow, given that the
        size of the overall grocery market was $632 billion in 2018 according to
        IBISWorld. Online grocery shopping has grown substantially during the
        COVID-19 pandemic.

        Impact on the environment
      </h2>
      <p className=" bg-slate-300">
        Online grocery stores may allow facilitating local food which may reduce
        the environmental impact of food transport. Small-scale farmers have
        been embracing digital technologies as a way to directly sell produce,
        and community-supported agriculture and direct-sell delivery systems are
        on the rise during the coronavirus pandemic.Furthermore, weekly grocery
        deliveries can be a better choice than individual trips to a store.Some
        online grocery stores have a goal of supporting the production and sale
        of fresh, organic, locally grown, sustainable foods

        Data and online grocers
      </h2>
      <p className=" bg-slate-300">
        The biggest advantage that online grocers have vis-a-vis
        brick-and-mortar store is more accurate data. Online grocers can use AI
        and machine-learning models to provide a more personalized experience
        for their customers. There are four main ways to utilize data for online
        grocers: creating smart shopping lists, personalizing discounts,
        personalizing the way items are shown to users, and providing
        contextualized recommendations. All these are intended to increase
        up-selling and cross-selling options as well as increase the customer's
        lifetime value.
